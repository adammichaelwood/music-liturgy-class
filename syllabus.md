# Liturgical Music in the Roman Rite: Historical Development and Practical Concerns

## Overview

### Who should take this course?

This course would be beneficial for anyone who has any role in the liturgy of the church, or an interest in its music.

It will be of great help to liturgists, liturgical coordinators, those who sing in or lead choirs, and those who serve on liturgy planning committees.

Musicians and music directors who trained as primarily secular musicians, or who were trained in Protestant or contemporary music forms, and who would like to have a deeper understanding of the musical requirements of the Roman Rite are especially encouraged to enroll.

### Course Description

This basic survey course encompasses over 2000 years of musical and liturgical history, beginning with the "hymns, psalms, and spiritual songs" of the early church, through the development of Western plainsong and sacred polyphony, to the music and musical issues of today. 

Special attention will be paid to the way in which music influences and is influenced by non-music factors such as:

 - liturgical structure and function,
 - theological development, and
 - socio-political movements.

While this historical survey will be necessarily brief, students will come away with a general understanding of the largest and most important movements of liturgical music in the history of the Western Church.

More importantly, the historical material will shed light on contemporary issues, helping students understand:

 - how the modern Roman Rite is structured,
 - what its musical requirements are, and 
 - how it got to be that way. 

### Student Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

 1. Understand and articulate the basic narrative of liturgical music history
 2. Identify the major genres of church music by ear
 3. Sing, in a group context and with leadership, some of the chants of the Mass 
 4. Identify the major ritual books of the Roman Rite
 5. Understand the musical structure of the modern Roman Rite in both of its forms
 6. Articulate the Church's requirements and preferences with regards liturgical music as set forth in the relevant legislation
 7. Speak intelligently and work collaboratively with music directors, organists, choir masters, liturgical ministers, and clergy on musical and liturgical matters.

### Course Procedure

The course will be lecture and discussion, with plenty of listening examples and some in-class singing. There will also be listening assignments in addition to reading.

Each scheduled class time will be divided into two separate class "periods."
